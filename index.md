## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering at Iowa State University, advised by [Dr. Jundi Liu](https://jundiliu.me/) and [Dr. Bowen Weng](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/bowen-weng). My research focuses on modeling human behavior through implicit and explicit feedback in interactions with autonomous agents. Another line of my work examines the relationship between humansâ€™ objective behaviors and their subjective preferences when engaging with such agents.
Before my PhD, I completed my BS at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).
