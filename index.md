## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering at Iowa State University, advised by [Dr. Jundi Liu](https://jundiliu.me/) and [Dr. Bowen Weng](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/bowen-weng). My research focuses on modeling human behavior through implicit and explicit feedback in interactions with autonomous agents. Another line of my work examines the relationship between humans’ objective behaviors and their subjective preferences when engaging with such agents.
Before my PhD, I completed my BS at [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).

## Notes
Over the course of my graduate studies, I found certain topics to be repeating over and over. 
Hence, whenever I took a mathematics or CS course, I would take summary notes. 
I thought it might be good to show them here; mainly to keep motivating myself to update them, 
and secondly for you to take a look and feel free to use them. 
Let me know if you read any of them and find any mistake!

## Services
Providing one-on-one math tutoring and mentorship to K–12 students through [CyMath](https://cymath.iastate.edu/).

## Beyond Research
Outside the lab, when I’m not [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/44255783), you’ll find me climbing or playing video games.
