## About Me

I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering at Iowa State University, advised by [Dr. Jundi Liu](https://jundiliu.me/) and [Dr. Bowen Weng](https://www.cs.iastate.edu/people/bowen-weng). My research concerns human behavior modeling through implicit and explicit feedback while embodied with autonomous agents. Another line of work of mine tries to understand the relationship between humans' objective behavior and their subjective preferences when dealing with such agents.
Before my PhD, I completed my BS from [Sharif University of Technology](https://en.sharif.edu/).
